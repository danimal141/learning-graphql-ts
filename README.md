# learning-graphql-ts

This project builds a sample GraphQL application to learn [this book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-graphql/9781492030706/).

Different from [the original](https://github.com/MoonHighway/learning-graphql), this project uses TypeScript, typeorm and type-graphql.

## How to develop
```
// setup
$ yarn
$ docker-compose up

// run all
// Then you can open `http://localhost:4000/playground` and `server/schema.gql` would be automatically generated
$ yarn dev 
```
